    "description": "Excited to share this thermal detection project that I developed for a hackathon hosted by Western Engineering & General Motors! Autonomous vehicles face a critical challenge: detecting obstacles in low-visibility conditions like nighttime, fog, or bad weather. Traditional cameras often struggle, but thermal cameras can capture heat signatures, making them valuable for identifying road users even in complete darkness. We built an embedded road user detection system that processes thermal camera feeds in real time, identifies pedestrians, cyclists, and vehicles with bounding boxes & confidence scores, and runs on a Raspberry Pi 5 for lightweight deployment.",
